### Intro

When looking for a way to format dates for multiple time zones and many languages, I came across the JavaScript [Intl API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl). This API provides date and time formatting capabilities allowing you to customize the language, time zone, and many other things.

Since it is impossible to apply a custom format using this API the same way you can with libraries such as [date-fns](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns), I build a playground to explore it and get to know it.

### Tech Stack
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Vercel as hosting platform

### Road Map
- [ ] Add the most used Intl methods
- - [x] DateTimeFormat
- - [ ] NumberFormat
- - [ ] ListFormat
- [ ] Add offline mode
- [ ] PWA
